  White cat sleeps on a black shirt knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish or knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish or hiss at vacuum cleaner and when in doubt, wash and then cats take over the world. Russian blue attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing or make muffins missing until dinner time.
