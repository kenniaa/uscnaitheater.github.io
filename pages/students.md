Students can participate through  multiple roles as part of the company—from actor, to stage manager to student director, from costume and set designers  to musicians to event coordinator. To take part in Theater Workshop, students  however must be in good academic standing and have demonstrated good conduct in their campus. As part of the company, they are expected to show responsibility and commitment in their <strong>attendance, communication </strong> and <strong>attitude.</strong>
 
When the season begins, the Workshop usually holds weekly rehearsals after school and on weekends either at a location at USC, the USC Village or Foshay.  A production process usually takes approximately 10-12 weeks, from auditions, casting, rehearsal through and production weeks.  
 
During final weeks of show, students will be expected to be at all Dress and Tech Rehearsals.
 
Students are also expected to attend weekly lunch meetings, check email and other communication channels to keep updated. Students also must keep parents updated regarding Theater Workshop expectations.
 
A detailed calendar will be available via googlegroups and will be updated regularly.
 
Students are expected to take part in Theater Workshop  work sessions, activities, fieldtrips, seminars and fundraisers.
 
Student participants gain leadership skills, performing arts experience, Language Arts development. The Theater Workshop has been a key component of successful students’ extra-curricular involvement and achievements and also awards community service hours for successful participation.
